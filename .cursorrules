# Your Requirements:
1.  **ABSOLUTE PRIORITY: SECURITY VULNERABILITY MITIGATION.**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY REFACTOR `mindsearch/agent/graph.py` to ELIMINATE ALL DIRECT `exec()` CALLS FOR LLM-GENERATED CODE.**
    *   You are required to implement a **STRICTLY SANDBOXED EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT** or a **RIGOROUS, EXPLICIT ALLOW-LIST** for any operations executed from LLM output. NO ARBITRARY CODE EXECUTION IS PERMITTED IN PRODUCTION.
2.  **UNIFIED CONFIGURATION STRATEGY:**
    *   All backend API URLs (e.g., `http://localhost:8002/solve`) **MUST BE DYNAMICALLY CONFIGURED** via environment variables or a shared configuration service.
    *   **NEVER HARDCODE** backend API URLs in frontend UIs (React's `vite.config.ts`, `frontend/mindsearch_gradio.py`, `frontend/mindsearch_streamlit.py`).
3.  **ROBUST UI STATE MANAGEMENT:**
    *   For Gradio UIs: **NEVER USE GLOBAL VARIABLES** for chat history (`PLANNER_HISTORY`, `SEARCHER_HISTORY`). Implement `gr.State` or other session-isolated patterns for multi-user concurrency.
    *   For Streamlit UIs: Simplify and clarify `st.session_state` management. Ensure explicit support for multi-turn conversations, removing contradictory comments.
4.  **ENHANCE CODE QUALITY AND MAINTAINABILITY:**
    *   **REVIEW AND RE-ENABLE ALL RELEVANT PYLINT CHECKS** currently disabled in `.pylintrc`, especially those related to code complexity (`too-many-*`), maintainability, and documentation.
    *   All new Python code **MUST INCLUDE COMPREHENSIVE DOCSTRINGS** for modules, classes, and public functions/methods.
5.  **ROBUST GRADIO UI STYLING:**
    *   **DO NOT RELY ON FRAGILE, GENERATED `#component-X` IDs** in `gradio_front.css`.
    *   You are required to implement more robust styling solutions using Gradio's official theming capabilities, stable class-based approaches, or custom components with well-defined, persistent styles.
6.  **CLARIFY AND OPTIMIZE ROOT `Dockerfile`:**
    *   **EITHER REMOVE THE ROOT `Dockerfile`** if it is not actively used by the MSDL tool, or **FULLY INTEGRATE IT INTO MSDL's TEMPLATE SYSTEM**.
    *   If integrated, fix all inconsistencies (e.g., port mismatches) and adopt Docker multi-stage build best practices. **NEVER use `git clone .` in a Dockerfile; always `COPY` source code.**
7.  **RESOLVE SSE RECONNECTION ISSUE:**
    *   Investigate and resolve the documented Server-Sent Events (SSE) reconnection issue in the React frontend for a seamless user experience upon page navigation. Implement robust client-side reconnection logic.
8.  **IMPROVE GRANULAR ERROR HANDLING:**
    *   Implement more specific `try-except` blocks and provide informative, actionable error messages to users and logs across all components (backend, MSDL, UIs), especially for network interactions, Docker failures, and critical operational failures.
9.  **MAINTAIN CORE STRENGTHS:** Continue to develop with a modular, layered design, prioritizing the streaming-first approach for real-time AI agent transparency and efficient asynchronous capabilities.
10. **TRANSPARENT AI INTERACTION:** Ensure that the AI agent's thought processes and tool usage are clearly visualized and streamed to the user, enhancing trust and understanding.

# Knowledge Framework

# MindSearch Project Architecture

MindSearch is an advanced, AI-powered information retrieval framework designed for transparent, multi-step search capabilities. It employs a well-defined multi-faceted architecture with clear separation of concerns:

-   **Core AI Agent & Backend (`mindsearch/`)**: The intellectual core, managing AI agents, LLM interactions, graph-based reasoning, and exposed via a FastAPI server.
-   **Frontend Interfaces (`frontend/`)**: Provides various user interaction layers, including a modern React/TypeScript application, and Python-based UIs built with Gradio and Streamlit.
-   **Containerization & Deployment (`docker/`, Root Dockerfiles)**: A robust Docker-based system, featuring a custom Python-based CLI tool (`MSDL`) for automated multi-service orchestration and environment setup.
-   **Project Systems & Development Utilities (Cross-cutting)**: Encompasses general configurations, internationalization, code quality tooling, and comprehensive documentation.

## Core AI Agent & Backend (`mindsearch/`)

This is the brain of the MindSearch application, housing the primary intelligence, AI agent orchestration, and business logic. It handles query processing, multi-step reasoning, and interaction with external LLMs and search tools.

### Key Technologies & Frameworks:
-   **Python:** Primary programming language.
-   **FastAPI:** High-performance web framework for the backend API.
-   **Lagent:** Implicitly used for LLM integration, agent orchestration, and streaming.
-   **Pydantic:** For data modeling and validation.
-   **Implicit AI/ML/Agent Libraries:** Likely utilizes `langchain`, `llama_index`, `transformers`, `openai`, `torch`, `tensorflow`, and `networkx` for graph manipulation.

### File-Level Details:
-   **`mindsearch/agent/__init__.py`**: Centralizes agent initialization, dynamically configuring synchronous/asynchronous agents, LLMs, and web search plugins. Supports multilingual prompts and caches LLM instances.
-   **`mindsearch/agent/graph.py`**: Defines `WebSearchGraph` for graph-based problem decomposition, `SearcherAgent` for individual web searches, and **`ExecutionAction` (a tool) that currently uses `exec()` to run LLM-generated Python code and streams graph updates. This file is the primary focus for security remediation.** Leverages `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `asyncio` for parallel searches.
-   **`mindsearch/agent/mindsearch_agent.py`**: The high-level orchestrator (`MindSearchAgent`), planning and executing search workflows, processing results, and generating final summaries. Implements an iterative `max_turn` loop and streams outputs.
-   **`mindsearch/agent/mindsearch_prompt.py`**: Centralizes all LLM prompt templates (system, few-shot, input/output) for the planning agent and searcher agent in both Chinese and English. Employs prompt engineering best practices for structured output.
-   **`mindsearch/agent/models.py`**: Configuration hub for various LLMs (InternLM, GPT-4, Qwen, SiliconFlow), defining their types, paths, chat templates, and generation parameters. Securely fetches API keys from environment variables.
-   **`mindsearch/agent/streaming.py`**: Provides core streaming capabilities for `lagent` agents via mixins, enabling incremental yielding of thoughts, tool calls, and partial responses using `AgentMessage` objects and `AgentStatusCode`.
-   **`mindsearch/app.py`**: The FastAPI backend API (`/solve` endpoint) that interacts with the agent. It supports synchronous/asynchronous execution and streams responses using Server-Sent Events (SSE). Handles CORS, request validation, and post-processing of agent messages for client-side consumption.
-   **`backend_example.py`**: A Python client-side example demonstrating how to send queries to the FastAPI backend and consume streamed SSE responses.

### Key Design Patterns & Strengths:
-   **Modular & Layered Design:** Clear separation of agent logic, LLM configurations, and API exposure.
-   **Streaming-First Approach:** Designed for real-time feedback, crucial for AI agent transparency and user experience.
-   **Asynchronous Capabilities:** Efficient handling of I/O-bound tasks, especially parallel web searches.
-   **Structured Reasoning:** Graph-based decomposition enables complex, multi-step problem-solving.
-   **Extensibility:** Easy to integrate new LLMs or search tools.
-   **Prompt Engineering Excellence:** Detailed and structured prompts guide LLM behavior effectively.

## Frontend Interfaces (`frontend/`)

Provides diverse user interfaces for interacting with the MindSearch agent.

### Key Technologies & Frameworks:
-   **React, TypeScript, Vite, LESS:** For the modern web application.
-   **Gradio:** Python library for quick ML model UIs.
-   **Streamlit:** Python framework for data apps.
-   **Node.js/npm:** For React project dependency management.

### React Frontend (`frontend/React/`)
-   **`src/App.tsx`, `src/index.tsx`**: Root React components and entry point.
-   **`package.json`**: Defines React project metadata, scripts (start, build, prettier), and dependencies (React, React Router, Ant Design, Axios, EventSource polyfill, AntV X6, ReactFlow, React Markdown, etc.).
-   **`vite.config.ts`**: Vite configuration, including React and legacy browser plugins, path aliases, CSS Modules config, and a proxy for `/solve` API calls (this proxy URL **MUST** be dynamically configured).

### Gradio UI (`frontend/css/gradio_front.css`, `frontend/gradio_agentchatbot/`, `frontend/mindsearch_gradio.py`)
-   **`frontend/gradio_agentchatbot/agentchatbot.py`**: Defines a custom `AgentChatbot` Gradio component, extending base functionality to display rich agent messages including `ThoughtMetadata` and file attachments.
-   **`frontend/mindsearch_gradio.py`**: Implements the Gradio web interface, using `AgentChatbot` to visualize agent planning and search processes. It dynamically updates two chatbots and a search graph visualization (`schemdraw`) based on streaming backend responses. **Currently uses global variables for chat history and hardcoded backend URL.**
-   **`frontend/css/gradio_front.css`**: Global CSS for customizing Gradio UI elements. **Currently uses fragile, auto-generated Gradio component IDs (`#component-X`) for styling.**

### Streamlit UI (`frontend/mindsearch_streamlit.py`)
-   **`frontend/mindsearch_streamlit.py`**: Implements an alternative Streamlit web interface. Uses `st.session_state` for chat history and visualizes the search graph using `pyvis.network`. **`st.session_state` management is complex and needs simplification. Also uses hardcoded backend URL.**

## Containerization & Deployment (`docker/`, Root Dockerfiles)

Manages the consistent and reproducible deployment of the MindSearch application using Docker. It features a custom Python-based CLI tool called `MSDL` (MindSearch Docker Launcher) that automates the orchestration of multi-service applications.

### Key Technologies & Frameworks:
-   **Docker Engine, Docker Compose:** For containerization and orchestration.
-   **Python:** For the `MSDL` CLI tool.
-   **YAML:** For Docker Compose and MSDL's internal translation files.
-   **`python-dotenv`, `inquirerpy`, `pyyaml`:** Python libraries used by MSDL.

### MSDL Components (`docker/msdl/`)
-   **`docker/msdl/__main__.py`**: Main entry point for the `msdl` CLI. Orchestrates user interaction, copies Dockerfile templates, modifies `docker-compose.yaml`, and manages Docker Compose commands.
-   **`docker/msdl/config.py`**: Centralizes configuration parameters.
-   **`docker/msdl/docker_manager.py`**: Abstracts Docker and Docker Compose command execution, including dynamic updates to `docker-compose.yaml`.
-   **`docker/msdl/i18n.py`**: Manages internationalization for MSDL.
-   **`docker/msdl/user_interaction.py`**: Drives interactive user experience, collecting inputs (model type, API keys, etc.).
-   **`docker/msdl/utils.py`**: Provides utility functions for env vars, file management, and dynamic YAML manipulation.
-   **`docker/msdl/templates/docker-compose.yaml`**: A base template defining `backend` and `frontend` services, dynamically modified by MSDL.

### Other Docker-related Files:
-   **`.dockerignore`**: Specifies files/directories to exclude from the Docker build context.
-   **`Dockerfile` (Project Root)**: Defines a general-purpose Docker image for the backend using Conda. **This Dockerfile is ambiguous: it may not be used by MSDL and contains inconsistencies (e.g., port mismatch) and less secure build practices (`git clone` instead of `COPY`).**

## Project Systems & Development Utilities (Cross-cutting)

Covers overarching configurations, code quality tools, documentation standards, and general utilities.

### Key Technologies & Frameworks:
-   **Markdown:** For documentation files.
-   **Environment Variables (`.env`)**: For managing environment-specific configurations.
-   **Pre-commit:** Framework for managing multi-language pre-commit hooks.
-   **Pylint:** Static code analysis tool for Python.
-   **Prettier:** Opinionated code formatter.

### File-Level Details:
-   **`.env.example`**: Template for environment variables, especially for LLM API keys.
-   **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: Configures pre-commit hooks for automated code quality checks and formatting across Python, Markdown, etc.
-   **`.pylintrc`**: Customizes Pylint's static code analysis rules. **NOTABLY, it extensively disables common warnings related to code complexity and documentation, which must be re-evaluated and corrected.**
-   **`README_zh-CN.md`**: Comprehensive project overview in Simplified Chinese.

# Implementation Examples

## Unified Backend URL Configuration (Vite React Example)

Instead of hardcoding, fetch the backend URL from an environment variable injected during the build process.

```typescript
// frontend/React/vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig, loadEnv } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import legacy from '@vitejs/plugin-legacy';
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => {
  const env = loadEnv(mode, process.cwd(), '');
  const BACKEND_API_URL = env.VITE_BACKEND_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8002'; // Default for local dev

  return {
    plugins: [react(), legacy()],
    css: {
      preprocessorOptions: {
        less: {
          javascriptEnabled: true,
        },
      },
      modules: {
        scopeBehaviour: 'local',
      },
    },
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
      },
    },
    server: {
      proxy: {
        '/solve': {
          target: BACKEND_API_URL,
          changeOrigin: true,
          secure: false, // For local dev with http, ensure this is handled securely in production
        },
      },
    },
    base: './',
  };
});
```
**Explanation:** The `VITE_BACKEND_API_URL` environment variable will dynamically set the backend URL. This variable would be set in a `.env` file (e.g., `VITE_BACKEND_API_URL=http://your-production-backend.com:8002`) or via Docker environment variables.

## Safer ExecutionAction Stub (Conceptual Example)

A conceptual example of how `ExecutionAction` should be refactored to avoid `exec()`. This will likely involve a dedicated, isolated execution service.

```python
# mindsearch/agent/graph.py (Conceptual Refactor - NOT REAL CODE YET)
import subprocess
import json
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class ExecutionAction(Tool):
    """
    A tool to safely execute LLM-generated Python code within a sandboxed environment.
    Avoids direct exec() for security.
    """
    name: str = "ExecutionAction"
    description: str = "Executes Python code safely in a sandboxed environment. Input is the Python code string."
    coroutine: bool = True

    async def _call(self, python_code: str) -> str:
        try:
            # Placeholder for actual sandboxed execution.
            # This could involve:
            # 1. Sending the code to a dedicated, isolated Docker container with strict resource limits and network restrictions.
            # 2. Using a language-level sandboxing library (e.g., RestrictedPython, though these are often insufficient for true security).
            # 3. Implementing a strict allow-list of functions/modules that LLMs can call, executed directly.

            # !!! WARNING: The following is a conceptual placeholder and NOT a secure implementation. !!!
            # For demonstration, assume a hypothetical 'sandbox_execute' function that
            # interacts with a secure execution service.
            logger.info(f"Attempting to execute code in sandbox: {python_code[:200]}...")
            result = await self._send_to_sandbox_service(python_code)
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error executing code in sandbox: {e}")
            return f"Error during code execution: {e}"

    async def _send_to_sandbox_service(self, code: str) -> str:
        """
        Hypothetical function to send code to an external, secure execution service.
        This service would run the code in a truly isolated, sandboxed environment.
        """
        # In a real scenario, this would be an HTTP call, a message queue, etc.
        # For now, simulate a restricted execution.
        if "os.system" in code or "shutil" in code or "subprocess" in code:
            return "Error: Restricted function call detected. Execution denied."
        
        # This is still NOT secure. A real sandbox is complex.
        # A simple, secure approach might be to only allow specific, pre-defined functions
        # that LLMs can call, and validate the input parameters for these functions.
        return "Code execution simulated: This needs a real sandbox implementation."

```
**Explanation:** This example conceptually moves `exec()` calls to a `_send_to_sandbox_service` which would interact with a dedicated, hardened execution environment (e.g., a separate Docker container with minimal permissions, or a secure serverless function). The key is that the LLM's output is *never* directly `exec()`-ed in the main application process.

## Robust Gradio Styling (Using Theming)

Instead of relying on fragile `#component-X` IDs, use Gradio's theming capabilities or stable CSS classes.

```python
# frontend/mindsearch_gradio.py (Snippet)
import gradio as gr
from gradio_agentchatbot import AgentChatbot
# ... other imports

# Define a custom Gradio theme
custom_theme = gr.themes.Soft(
    primary_hue="blue",
    secondary_hue="blue",
    neutral_hue="slate",
    text_color_subdued="#6B7280",
    shadow_soft="0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)",
    border_color_accent="#D1D5DB",
    spacing_size="md",
    radius_size="md",
    font=[gr.themes.GoogleFont("Inter"), "system-ui", "sans-serif"],
    font_mono=[gr.themes.GoogleFont("IBM Plex Mono"), "monospace"],
).set(
    background_fill_primary="url(/file=assets/bg_image.png) no-repeat center center fixed",
    background_fill_secondary="#F9FAFB",
    block_background_fill="#FFFFFF",
    # Override component-specific styles via CSS variables or stable classes if available
    # For example, to style the chatbot message bubbles:
    # `gr-bubble-background`: "#E0F2FE", // Light blue for sent messages
    # `gr-bubble-background-inverted`: "#F3F4F6", // Light grey for received messages
)

# ... later in the code
with gr.Blocks(theme=custom_theme, css="""
    /* General body styling, if not fully covered by theme */
    body {
        background-size: cover !important;
    }
    /* Stable class for chat messages, if gr.themes isn't enough */
    .gradio-container .message {
        border-radius: 8px;
        padding: 8px 12px;
    }
    /* Avoid using #component-X */
""") as demo:
    # ... your Gradio UI definition
    gr.Chatbot(...)
    # ...
```
**Explanation:** By defining a `gr.themes.Soft` object and applying it to `gr.Blocks`, you can control the overall look and feel robustly. For more granular control, use stable CSS classes provided by Gradio or target HTML elements more generically, avoiding brittle auto-generated IDs. Ensure local hosting of images (e.g., `/file=assets/bg_image.png`) instead of raw GitHub URLs.

## Gradio Session-Isolated State Management

Use `gr.State` to manage chat history per user session, avoiding global variables.

```python
# frontend/mindsearch_gradio.py (Snippet for state management)
import gradio as gr
from gradio_agentchatbot import AgentChatbot
from gradio_agentchatbot.utils import ChatbotData # Assuming this is the Pydantic model for history
# ... other imports

def initialize_chat_data():
    """Initializes chat history for a new session."""
    return ChatbotData(planner_history=[], searcher_history=[])

def on_send_message(message_text, current_chat_data: ChatbotData):
    """Handles new message, updates state, and processes with agent."""
    # Add user message to history
    current_chat_data.planner_history.append([message_text, None])
    # Placeholder for actual agent call
    # agent_response = agent.run(message_text)
    # current_chat_data.planner_history.append([None, agent_response])
    
    # Simulate agent response
    current_chat_data.planner_history.append([None, f"Agent thought: Processed '{message_text}'"])

    return current_chat_data, current_chat_data.planner_history # Return updated state and display history

with gr.Blocks(theme=custom_theme, css=css_rules) as demo:
    # Use gr.State for session-isolated chat history
    chat_data_state = gr.State(initialize_chat_data)

    with gr.Row():
        with gr.Column(scale=1):
            planner_chatbot = AgentChatbot(
                label="Planner Chatbot",
                elem_id="planner-chatbot",
                height=500,
                show_label=False
            )
            # ... other components

    msg = gr.Textbox(label="Your message", placeholder="Type your query here...")
    send_btn = gr.Button("Send")

    send_btn.click(
        fn=on_send_message,
        inputs=[msg, chat_data_state],
        outputs=[chat_data_state, planner_chatbot],
        queue=False
    )
    msg.submit(
        fn=on_send_message,
        inputs=[msg, chat_data_state],
        outputs=[chat_data_state, planner_chatbot],
        queue=False
    )
```
**Explanation:** `gr.State` ensures that `initialize_chat_data` is called once per user session, providing an isolated `ChatbotData` object. This object is then passed to and updated by the `on_send_message` function, preventing concurrency issues.

# Negative Patterns

## Security Anti-patterns

-   **Direct `exec()` for LLM-Generated Code**: Directly using `exec()` or `eval()` on unsanitized, LLM-generated code in `mindsearch/agent/graph.py`.
    ```python
    # WRONG: CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY
    exec(llm_generated_code)
    ```
-   **Cloning Repository in Dockerfile**: Using `git clone .` or similar commands in a `Dockerfile` during the build process instead of `COPY . /app`. This is less secure and less efficient.
    ```dockerfile
    # WRONG: Less secure, less efficient
    RUN git clone https://github.com/SlyyCooper/MindSearch.git /app
    WORKDIR /app
    ```

## Configuration Anti-patterns

-   **Hardcoding Backend URLs**: Embedding `http://localhost:8002/solve` directly in frontend code (e.g., in `frontend/mindsearch_gradio.py`, `frontend/mindsearch_streamlit.py`, `frontend/React/vite.config.ts`).
    ```python
    # WRONG: Hardcoded URL in Gradio UI
    backend_url = "http://localhost:8002/solve"
    response = requests.post(backend_url, json=payload, stream=True)
    ```

## UI State & Styling Anti-patterns

-   **Global Variables for UI State**: Using global Python lists or dictionaries (e.g., `PLANNER_HISTORY`, `SEARCHER_HISTORY`) to store chat history in multi-user web UIs like Gradio. This leads to concurrency issues.
    ```python
    # WRONG: Global state for multi-user application
    PLANNER_HISTORY = []
    SEARCHER_HISTORY = []
    ```
-   **Brittle Gradio Styling**: Relying on auto-generated, unstable Gradio component IDs (e.g., `#component-123`) for styling in `frontend/css/gradio_front.css`.
    ```css
    /* WRONG: Prone to breakage with Gradio updates */
    #component-15 .block {
        background-color: #F0F0F0;
    }

## Code Quality Anti-patterns

-   **Overly Permissive Pylint Configuration**: Disabling numerous critical Pylint checks related to code complexity (`too-many-branches`, `too-many-statements`), maintainability, and documentation (`missing-function-docstring`, `missing-class-docstring`) in `.pylintrc`.
    ```ini
    # WRONG: Weakens code quality enforcement
    [MESSAGES CONTROL]
    disable=
        too-many-branches,
        too-many-statements,
        missing-function-docstring,
        missing-class-docstring,
        # ... and many more
    ```
-   **Missing Docstrings**: Writing functions, classes, or modules without proper docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.

## Deployment Anti-patterns

-   **Ambiguous/Inconsistent Root `Dockerfile`**: Maintaining a `Dockerfile` at the project root that is not clearly integrated into the primary deployment tool (MSDL) and contains inconsistencies or insecure practices.

# Knowledge Evolution:

As you learn new patterns or encounter corrections, document them in `.cursor/rules/mindsearch-lessons-learned.mdc` using the following format:

## [Category]

-   [Old pattern] → [New pattern]
-   [Incorrect assumption] → [Correct information]

## Examples of documented learnings:

-   **Security**: Direct `exec()` calls for LLM-generated code → Sandboxed execution via isolated microservice.
-   **Configuration**: Hardcoded backend URLs in frontend → Dynamic configuration via environment variables.
-   **Gradio UI**: Global chat history variables → `gr.State` for session-isolated history management.
-   **Gradio UI**: Fragile `#component-X` styling → Robust styling using `gr.themes` and stable CSS classes.
-   **Code Quality**: Permissive `.pylintrc` → Re-enabled critical Pylint checks and enforced docstrings.
-   **Deployment**: Root `Dockerfile` with `git clone` → Consolidated Dockerfile integrated with MSDL using `COPY` and multi-stage builds.
-   **SSE**: Unresolved SSE reconnection issue → Implemented robust client-side reconnection logic.
