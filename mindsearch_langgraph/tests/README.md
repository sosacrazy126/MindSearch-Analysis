## Running Tests

### Basic Test Run
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_state.py

# Run specific test class
pytest tests/test_benefits.py::TestClaimedBenefits

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_benefits.py::TestClaimedBenefits::test_no_infinite_loops
```

### Test Categories
```bash
# Run only unit tests
pytest -m unit

# Run only integration tests
pytest -m integration

# Run only end-to-end tests
pytest -m e2e

# Run only performance tests
pytest -m performance

# Run tests excluding slow ones
pytest -m "not slow"

# Run tests excluding real API calls
pytest -m "not real_apis"
```

### With Coverage
```bash
# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Open coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Run performance tests with detailed output
pytest -m performance -v -s

# Run with performance profiling
pytest --profile tests/test_search_engines.py::TestSearchPerformance
```

### Real API Testing
```bash
# Enable real API tests (requires API keys)
export USE_REAL_APIS=true
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
pytest -m real_apis
```

## Test Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `USE_REAL_APIS`: Set to "true" to enable real API tests
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for real LLM tests
- `PYTEST_TIMEOUT`: Override default test timeout (60s)

### pytest.ini Configuration
- Automatic test discovery in `tests/` directory
- Async test support with `pytest-asyncio`
- Colored output and verbose logging
- Coverage reporting configuration

## Key Test Scenarios

### 1. **Loop Prevention Test**
```python
# Validates that the graph prevents infinite loops
async def test_no_infinite_loops():
    # Runs queries designed to trigger loops
    # Verifies completion within timeout
    # Checks visit counts stay within limits
```

### 2. **Parallel Performance Test**
```python
# Validates 3x speedup claim
async def test_3x_performance_improvement():
    # Measures sequential execution time
    # Measures parallel execution time
    # Asserts speedup >= 2.5x
```

### 3. **Code Reduction Test**
```python
# Validates 80% code reduction claim
def test_80_percent_code_reduction():
    # Counts lines in implementation
    # Compares to original estimate
    # Verifies significant reduction
```

### 4. **State Isolation Test**
```python
# Validates no state corruption
async def test_state_corruption_prevention():
    # Runs multiple concurrent searches
    # Verifies each gets independent results
    # Checks no cross-contamination
```

## Expected Test Results

When all tests pass, you should see:
- ✅ ~100+ tests passing
- ✅ 80-100% code coverage
- ✅ Performance benchmarks meeting targets
- ✅ All benefits validated

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure you're in the project root and have installed dependencies
2. **Async Warnings**: Normal for async tests, suppressed in pytest.ini
3. **API Test Failures**: Check API keys and network connectivity
4. **Performance Test Variations**: Some variation is normal, tests allow margin

### Running Individual Test Categories

For faster development cycles:
```bash
# Quick unit tests only
pytest -m unit --tb=short

# Skip slow tests
pytest -m "not slow and not real_apis"

# Debug specific test
pytest -s -vv tests/test_specific.py::test_name
```

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed for CI/CD:
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    pytest -m "not real_apis" --cov=src --cov-report=xml
    
- name: Upload coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```
